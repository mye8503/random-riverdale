## random-riverdale

Do you ever feel like *Riverdale* makes too much sense? Look no further than this repository, which recommends you a random episode as well as keeping track of episodes you've already watched.


### How to use me

From the command line, navigate to the folder containing the file `riverdale.py` and run the command `python riverdale.py`.

If you downloaded the `unwatched_episodes.txt` and `watched_episodes.txt` files as well, you will have to reset them as they have my watch information. Run the command `python riverdale.py reset` first.


### Why I made this
I made this repository because I wanted to save my watch information across multiple computers.
